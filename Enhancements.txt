  Phase 1: MCP Protocol Enhancement (High Priority)

  1. Add MCP Resources
  - Expose saved queries as resources
  - Dataset/table metadata as browsable resources
  - Query templates as resources
  - Would enable Claude to "browse" your data catalog

  2. Add MCP Prompts
  - Pre-built prompts for common analytics tasks
  - "Analyze sales trends", "Compare datasets", "Generate report"
  - Make it easier for users to leverage BigQuery data

  3. Sampling Support
  - Add MCP sampling capabilities for large result sets
  - Progressive loading of query results
  - Better UX for exploring large datasets

  Phase 2: Performance & Efficiency (Medium Priority)

  4. Query Result Caching
  - Cache frequent queries (Redis/local cache)
  - Reduce BigQuery costs and improve response time
  - TTL-based invalidation

  5. Query Optimization Hints
  - Analyze query patterns and suggest optimizations
  - Partition pruning suggestions
  - Index recommendations based on query history

  6. Streaming Results
  - Support for large result sets via streaming
  - Avoid loading entire result set into memory
  - Better for real-time dashboards

  7. Parallel Query Execution
  - Execute multiple independent queries concurrently
  - Aggregate results from multiple datasets
  - Improve response time for complex analyses

  Phase 3: BigQuery Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

  8. Materialized Views Support
  - Create and manage materialized views
  - Pre-aggregate common queries
  - Reduce costs for repeated analyses

  9. Parameterized Queries
  - Support for query parameters
  - Prevent SQL injection (additional layer)
  - Enable query reuse with different parameters

  10. Scheduled Queries
  - Schedule recurring queries
  - Export results to Cloud Storage/BigQuery tables
  - Automated reporting

  11. BigQuery ML Integration
  - Access to BigQuery ML models
  - Run predictions through MCP
  - Train simple models on your data

  12. Federated Queries
  - Query external data sources (Cloud Storage, Sheets, etc.)
  - Combine BigQuery with other data
  - Expand data access capabilities

  Phase 4: Advanced Analytics (Lower Priority)

  13. Query History & Analytics
  - Track query patterns and usage
  - Cost analytics per user/query type
  - Performance monitoring

  14. Data Lineage Tracking
  - Track which queries access which tables
  - Understand data dependencies
  - Compliance and auditing

  15. Natural Language to SQL
  - Use Claude to generate SQL from natural language
  - Semantic layer mapping
  - Make data accessible to non-SQL users

  16. Smart Query Suggestions
  - Based on table schema and query history
  - Suggest relevant joins
  - Recommend useful aggregations

  Phase 5: Enterprise Features (Future)

  17. Multi-tenant Support
  - User-based access control
  - Per-user query limits
  - Separate billing tracking

  18. Data Governance
  - PII detection and masking
  - Column-level security
  - Compliance reporting (GDPR, HIPAA)

  19. Query Approval Workflow
  - Expensive queries require approval
  - Review before execution
  - Budget management

  20. Integration Hub
  - Connect to BI tools (Looker, Tableau)
  - Export to data warehouses
  - Webhook notifications
